## Getting started

Fork the repository and clone it. Move into the code directory and install the Python dependencies.

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

Install pre-commit hooks.

```bash
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

Install the shot-scraper web browser.

```bash
pipenv run shot-scraper install
```

## Adding a site

Adding a new site requires that a new row be added to [`newshomepages/sources/sites.csv`](./newshomepages/sources/sites.csv) with, at a minimum, the handle, URL and timezone of the target. You can also override the systemâ€™s defaults by adding optional attributes for the width, height and time delay for the screenshots.

After doing that, you should verify the site works by running the `shoot.py` command and inspecting the result.

Then you should add the site to our schedule by inserting its handle name in the `matrix` of the relevant[GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/palewire/news-homepages/blob/main/.github/workflows/socal.yml#L15).
